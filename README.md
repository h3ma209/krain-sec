## ‚ú® Features

- [x] **Honeypot**  
  A simple honeypot that listens for suspicious connections and logs attacker activity.

  Planned: fake HTTP endpoints to attract attackers and log their requests.  

- [ ] **More ideas coming soon...**  
  Future features may include:
  - Port scanner trap
  - SSH brute-force trap
  - Anomaly detection with AI/ML
  - Visualization dashboard for logs
